% Bonferroni-mean based fuzzy k-nearest neighbor (BM-FKNN) algorithm
% INPUTS:
    % Xtrain: Train data is a n-by-m data matrix consisting of 
    % n patterns and m features(variables)
    % Ytrain: n dimensional class vector of Xtrain data (class labels should be in numerical form, eg. 1,2)
    % Xtest: Test data is a D-by-m data matrix consisting of D
    % patterns and m features
    % Ytest: D dimensional class vector of Xtest data
    % K: Number of nearest neighbors to be selected
    % p, q: Parameter values for Bonferroni mean operator
    % m: Scaling factor for fuzzy weights

% OUTPUTS:
    % predicted: Predicted class label for each test pattern in Xtest
    % memberships: Fuzzy class memberships values for each test pattern in Xtest
    % numhits: Number of correctly predicted test patterns
    
% 'Bonferroni_mean.m' is needed. 
% This file is needed to compute Bonferroni mean vectors of the set
% of nearest neighbor in each class
